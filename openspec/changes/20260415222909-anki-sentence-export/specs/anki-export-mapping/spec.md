## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Ordered Unified Field Mapping
The system SHALL support unified field mapping blocks (e.g., `[fields_mapping.word]`) where each line defines both the field name (key) and its data source (value) in a single assignment. The order of these assignments SHALL determine the TSV column sequence.

#### Scenario: Defining a unified field list
- **WHEN** `anki_mapping.ini` contains:
  ```ini
  [fields_mapping.word]
  Word=source_word
  Time=time
  ```
- **THEN** the system SHALL recognize a 2-column export structure where column 1 is the word and column 2 is the timestamp.
